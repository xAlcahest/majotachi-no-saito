* **********************************************************************
* *                vgperson's Custom Translation Engine                *
* **********************************************************************
*
* This plugin loads translation data from files in a "languages" folder,
* and will then automatically use appropriate text for the current language.
*
* Besides text from message/choice commands and database text,
* language files can also hold arbitrary user-added "extra" data
* to be referred to by plugin scripts or script commands.
*
* There are also a wide variety of other functions
* that can help assist with translation and checking for mistakes.
*
* For basic instructions on how to set things up and
* what most of the settings are for, read the Setup Procedure section.
* For details on all the different functions, read Feature Explanations.
*
*
* ======================================================================
*                            Setup Procedure
* ======================================================================
*
* 1. Add and enable this plugin in the Plugin Manager.
*
* Where you place it in the plugin list should usually only matter
* if you make plugins refer to its functions (i.e. CTE.getString()).
* If you put it at the very top, CTE will be initialized before anything,
* so you can safely directly edit plugins to refer to CTE functions.
*
* Alternatively, you can place it at the bottom of the list,
* and override the definitions of plugin functions as necessary
* within CustomTranslationEngine.js itself.
*
* --------------------------------------------------
*
* 2. Set up the Language Codes list.
*
* These codes represent all of the supported languages for the game,
* in the same order you want them displayed in the Options menu.
*
* You should be able to add to or rearrange these at any time without issue.
*
* --------------------------------------------------
*
* 3. Set the Base Language Code and Default Language Setting.
*
* The Base Language Code is the language of the base game.
* When a player is playing in this language, the base game data will be used.
*
* The Default Language Setting is the language the game initially launches in.
* This is overridden by saved user configuration data (i.e. config.rpgsave),
* which is made once the player goes into the Options menu.
* If left blank, the default setting will be the Base Language.
*
* You can have language settings from a launcher such as Steam
* override the Default Language Setting if configured properly.
* (See Customizable Handlers section.)
*
* --------------------------------------------------
*
* 4. Set up other lists under Per-Language Settings.
* These must all follow the same order as the list of Language Codes.
*
* ***** Language Display Names *****
* Language names shown in the Options menu.
*
* ***** Language Option Text *****
* Text for the "Language" option in the Options menu in each language.
*
* ***** Default Fonts *****
* Default fonts used for each language. Should use specific font names,
* or match font-family definitions in gamefont.css.
* If all languages use GameFont, you don't have to define anything.
*
* ***** Message Speeds *****
* Typing speed of messages per language. Default 1x (1 character per frame).
* If you just want 1x speed for all languages, you don't have to define this.
* If you're using another plugin that modifies message speed,
* speeds other than 1x may override its functionality, so be careful.
*
* --------------------------------------------------
*
* 5. To start translating, enable Launch Actions > Export Base Text,
* then run the game to generate base language data.
*
* This will put text data for the Base Language in the "languages" folder,
* which can then be renamed to a different language code and translated.
* (Launch actions like this only run in playtest mode and shouldn't occur
* in releases, but you might want to disable them when not needed.)
*
* The exported data is named after the Base Language Code by default,
* but will use the Base Export Filename if one is specified.
*
* You can also export base game text via the Export Actions menu,
* accessed by holding down the Script Reload key in-game.
*
* ***** "Export to Single File" Settings *****
* By default, language text is exported to a single .txt file.
* If desired, you can have it split up across multiple files in a subfolder.
*
* If "Export to Single File" is on, all text will go in a single "XX.txt"
* (where XX is the Base Language Code or Base Export Filename).
* If "Export to Single File" is off, an "XX" folder will be made,
* which will contain multiple files based on the other settings.
*
* Having "All-In-One Maps" on will put all map data into "AllMaps.txt",
* whereas having it off will generate an individual file for every map.
* The same pattern applies for Common Events, Troops, and Databases,
*
* NOTE: These settings do NOT affect how language files are loaded.
* Rather, loading always prioritizes "all-in-one" files first,
* then looks for individual files if those do not exist.
*
* For example, if a single "XX.txt" exists for the language code,
* it will be loaded and any other files that may exist will be ignored.
* If it does not, however, the plugin will check for each all-in-one file
* (AllMaps.txt, AllCommons.txt, AllTroops.txt, AllDatabases.txt),
* and if one does not exist, looks for individual files of that type.
*
* ***** A Note On Extraneous Language Files ***** 
* For public releases, you only need to include
* language files for languages other than the Base Language.
* The Base Language uses game data, so it doesn't need any files.
*
* If loading CTE files, you only need the ".cte"s for each language,
* and TXT language files/subfolders can be omitted for release.
* A TranslatedImages.txt file is only necessary if you're using
* auto image loading and intend for the game to be played in-browser.
* LanguageTable.csv and IdenticalWarnings.txt files
* are both purely for reference and can be omitted.
*
* Leaving extra files in won't cause any actual issues,
* but it may be a concern if you don't want people
* looking through plain text or development data.
*
* --------------------------------------------------
*
* 6. (Optional) Configure other settings as you wish.
*
* ***** Encryption Settings (Load From / Generate CTE Files) *****
* While you can use TXT-format language files directly,
* when actually publishing the game, you may want that data
* to be a compressed, encrypted file instead of plain text.
* This can be accomplished by generating CTE files.
*
* If you enable "Generate CTE Files," then in playtest mode,
* an encrypted CTE file will be generated every time
* TXT language files are loaded in (to keep it up to date).
* Then, for release, you can enable "Load From CTE Files"
* to load language data from CTE files instead of TXTs.
*
* Using this option, you can include just the CTE files in your release.
* Be sure not to lose the original TXT files, however,
* or you'll have no easy way to make edits to translations!
*
* You can also export the latest CTEs in the Export Actions menu,
* accessed by holding down the Script Reload key in-game.
*
* ***** Script Reload Keycode *****
* Keycode value for a debug key to reload all language scripts mid-game.
* Only usable in playtest mode. Default is 121 (F10 key); use 0 to disable.
*
* Pressing the Reload Key while a message box is up
* will re-display that message using the latest data.
*
* If you press the Reload Key with Load From CTE Files enabled,
* it actually loads the TXT files, then re-exports them as CTE files.
*
* Holding the Reload Key down in-game (while not in a scene) will display
* the Export Actions menu, which lets you perform the following:
* - Export text for the Base Language (same as launch action)
* - Export the Language Table (same as launch action)
* - Log identical text between languages (same as launch action)
* - Update all .cte files with the latest .txt data
* - Open the Message Typer for immediate message previewing
*
* ***** Message Debugger Keycode *****
* Keycode value for a debug key that opens a previewer for all messages.
* Only usable in playtest mode. Default is 122 (F11 key); use 0 to disable.
* Press the key again while the message debugger is open to search.
*
* ***** Console Log Detail *****
* How much console logging the plugin should do.
*
* None: Nothing will be logged to the console.
*
* Level 1 (Load/Export Messages):
* Logs info about files being loaded or exported.
*
* Level 2 (Load/Export + Missing Translations):
* In addition to Level 1 log messages,
* warns about missing or inconsistent translations.

*
*
*
* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
*  Command Text Replacement
* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
*
* Maps, Common Events, and Troop pages are structured as
* a list of all commands which contain text to be translated.
*
* Current map/file is set by markers in the format "=MapX=" or "=File=".
* Current event is set by markers in the format "*EventX*".
* Current page is set by markers in the format "-PageX-".
*
* (*CommonX* is used instead of *EventX* for Common Events
* (though either works), and *TroopX* is used within Troops.
* Also, common events don't have multiple pages.
* If using individual files instead of a single language file,
* some initial values are assumed based on the file; for instance,
* Common0001.txt has an implicit "=CommonEvents=" and "*Common1*".)
*
* Within a section, commands are given in a format like this:
* #Message#
* First line of message
* Second line of message
* ##
*
* The header, #Message#, indicates the type of command.
* The lines that follow make up the text content of the command.
* The terminator ## ends the command.
*
* Commands of the same type in the same "domain" (i.e. map page)
* go into an ordered list of command translations. This becomes the order
* in which they match to commands of that type in-game.
*
* Example:
* --------------------------------------------------
* [Event commands]
* Show Text: Hello!
* Wait: 10 frames
* Show Choice: Yes / No
* (arbitrary amount of non-Show Text commands)
* Show Text: Hello again!
* --------------------------------------------------
* [languages/EN.txt]
* #Message#
* Hello!
* ##
*
* #Choice#
* Yes
* No
* ##
*
* #Message#
* Hello again!
* ##
* --------------------------------------------------
*
* In this way, even if there are changes to the surrounding commands,
* you only have to change the language scripts
* if the order of text-containing commands changes,
* or if the map numbers, event IDs, or page numbers change.
*
* Also, a variety of contextual information is included on export,
* such as event names, coordinates, and choice branch names.
* This information is ignored when scripts are read;
* it is not critical to functionality and affects nothing.
*
* Similarly, outside of command content, as long as section markers are intact,
* you can add any text you wish as a "comment" and it will be ignored.
* (Example: "#Message# comment text" still reads as a Message command header.)
*
* An additional feature: If you want to remove a Message textbox entirely,
* define its translation as the following string:
* <<REMOVE>>
*
*
* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
*  Database Text Replacement
* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
*
* Database text uses a similar format to command text.
* The start of each database is marked by "=DatabaseName=",
* and database entries (if it's made up of entries) are marked by "*EntryX*".
*
* Fields within each entry, like "#Name#", are formatted just like commands.
* The only difference is that there's only ever one of each field per entry.
*
*
* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
*  Notes On Special Lookups
* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
*
* In cases where text is stored within the save file,
* this plugin opts to only ever store text from the Base Language,
* but localize it to the current language when displaying it to the player.
* In order to create original-to-translation "lookups" to accomplish this,
* these cases are formatted a bit differently in the scripts.
*
* The DisplayName field for maps uses a special format
* which includes the original text ("#DisplayName:ORIGINAL#"),
* to help support plugins that show map names on the file menu.
* *Do not alter the original text* - it will break that functionality!
*
* NameChange, NicknameChange, and ProfileChange commands work similarly;
* again, *altering the original text will break functionality.*
* Note that values from the fields in the Actor database also go into
* the name/nickname/profile lookups, but need not specify original text
* since they can automatically map to the base data.
*
*
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------
*  Translating String Variables
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------
*
* String variables can also be translated with a lookup-based approach.
* In the "Variables" section, you can define strings and their translations,
* and those strings will be converted for display purposes only.
*
* The plugin will attempt to locate as many string variable assignments
* as it can for export, but you may have to add some manually.
*
* The format for a definition is a header (either ## or #[options]#),
* followed by a line for the original, followed by a line for the translation.
*
* Example:
* ##
* Original text
* Translated text
*
* This would make it so that whenever a variable contains the exact,
* case-sensitive string "Original text", it will be displayed as
* "Translated text" in the language where this rule is defined.
* This should not affect any inner workings, and since the data keeps
* the original string, no problems should occur from switching languages.
*
* If you only want a translation to be applied to specific variables
* (for instance, a case where you want the same text to be
* translated differently for different variables), you can specify
* one or more variables to target (use commas for a list) in the header.
*
* Example:
* #V1,V2#
* Original text
* Translated text
*
* The above rule would only be applied to Variable 1 or Variable 2.
* Specifically-targeted rules take priority over general ones.
*
* You can also use regular expressions if you put "regex" in the header.
* Regular expressions must match the entire string, not just part of it.
* Captured groups in parentheses can be used in the translated text
* by adding zero-based numbers in curly braces, i.e. {0} {1} {2}.
*
* Examples:
* #regex#
* First (.*), then (.*)
* {0} is first, {1} is second
*
* #V1,regex#
* This is (.*), that is (.*)
* That is {1}, this is {0}
*
* The latter rule would swap the order of the captured words.
*
* ***** Notes On Extending Functionality ***** 
* This plugin only applies variable translation rules
* when converting escape characters for display in messages.
* So if you use plugins that display string variables
* without going through the convertEscapeCharacters() function,
* you must make modifications to localize those strings.
*
* If a plugin refers to the function $gameVariables.value(number),
* you can force it to be localized simply by adding a "true" argument
* (i.e. "$gameVariables.value(1, true)").
*
* Alternatively, if you set "CTE.localizeVariableOverride" to true,
* any calls to the $gameVariables.value function will be localized.
* But you should only use this in a temporary manner,
* setting it back to false as soon as the relevant code finishes;
* if you don't, it may cause issues like localized strings being
* written to save data and no longer changing to match language.
*
*
* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
*  Defining Custom Values
* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
*
* Generated scripts come with a placeholder "Extra" section.
* You can define custom values in this section
* to help localize any kind of text not otherwise included.
*
* Define as many language-relevant values as you wish
* using the format "VariableName=value".
* (String values do not need to be contained in quotes.)
* These can be retrieved anywhere using the functions
* CTE.getString("VariableName") and CTE.getNumber("VariableName").
*
* As an example, say you want the font size in a plugin script
* to be different depending on the current language.
* While this could be accomplished without Extra definitions,
* it can often be more convenient to use them.
*
* Method 1: Directly checking the current language in the script.
* --------------------------------------------------
* [js/plugins/Plugin.js]
* if (ConfigManager.isLanguage("JP")) contents.fontSize = 24;
* else if (ConfigManager.isLanguage("EN")) contents.fontSize = 20;
* --------------------------------------------------
*
* Method 2: Defining an value in the Extra section and referring to it.
* --------------------------------------------------
* [languages/EN.txt]
* =====Extra=====
* PluginFontSize=20
* --------------------------------------------------
* [js/plugins/Plugin.js]
* contents.fontSize = CTE.getNumber("PluginFontSize", 24);
* --------------------------------------------------
*
* The second argument for getNumber in Method 2 is the default value,
* used for the Base Language, or if no value is found for the current language.
*
* CTE.getString() works the same way, but treats the value as a string.
* (Or more accurately, getNumber() automatically converts to an integer.)
*
* Example:
* --------------------------------------------------
* [languages/EN.txt]
* =====Extra=====
* GlossaryOptionName=Dictionary
* --------------------------------------------------
* [js/plugins/Plugin.js]
* contents.drawText(CTE.getString("GlossaryOptionName", "Glossary"), 0, 0);
* --------------------------------------------------
*
* This displays "Dictionary" in English and "Glossary" in the Base Language,
* or any other language that does not define GlossaryOptionName.
*
*
* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
*  Alternate Image Loading
* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
*
* For cases where images differ depending on the language
* (containing text that needs translation, generally),
* this plugin can automatically load the appropriate image
* for the current language.
*
* Method 1:
* If you name an image "name_XX", where XX is the Base Language Code,
* this plugin will automatically try to load the equivalent image
* for the current language code (i.e. "name_YY").
*
* Example:
* If there is a Show Picture command that displays the image "test_JP",
* when playing in English (language code EN), it will display "test_EN".
* (If no image named "test_EN" exists, it will fall back on "test_JP".)
*
* Method 2:
* Within the appropriate image folder (i.e. "pictures", "parallaxes"),
* create a subfolder for each non-base language code (i.e. "EN").
* Place translated images in those language subfolders,
* using the exact same filename as the base image,
* and they will be used automatically for that language.
*
* --------------------------------------------------
* WARNING
* Because only NW.js mode (standalone executable) has the ability to
* quickly check whether a file exists, this feature requires extra measures
* to function when the game is played in a browser.
*
* Make sure the "Make Image List" setting is enabled,
* then run the game in playtest mode (which uses NW.js).
* This auto-generates TranslatedImages.txt in the languages folder,
* a list of translated images that exist for each language.
* Besides generating on launch, it should also update
* if a new translated image gets loaded mid-game.
*
* As long as TranslatedImages.txt is up to date,
* image loading functionality should work the same in-browser.
* --------------------------------------------------
*
* Note that Alternate Image Loading applies to any kind of image,
* so it can even be used for things like tile or character graphics.
* However, not everything may update immediately on language change.
* (May be fixable with language refresh handler; see Customizable Handlers.)
*
*
* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
*  Language-Conditional Pages
* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
*
* If you need to do something complicated with events and language,
* like having a whole different event layout based on language,
* you can require a certain language for an event page to trigger.
*
* Add a comment to the top of the page that includes
* "<CTELanguage:EN>", and that page will only trigger/be visible in English.
* You can also use commas to specify multiple languages:
* "<CTELanguage:JP,EN>" will make it trigger in Japanese or English.
*
*
* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
*  Command Text Conditions
* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
*
* There may be times when you want to split a command
* into two or more cases based on some condition,
* but don't want to have to add a branch in the code itself,
* particularly since it may not be needed in every language.
* (A common instance of this is plurality for variable amounts.)
*
* You can use the syntax "＠if [condition]" and "＠else" inside a command
* to define conditions and the text to use if that condition is met.
*
* (Note: For technical reasons, this plugin description cannot use
* a normal "at sign" character. Thus, a "full-width" one is used here,
* but conditions allow either a normal or full-width "at sign" to be used.
* Sorry for the confusion.)
*
* Be aware that the FIRST satisfied condition in the list will be used,
* meaning higher-priority conditions should be given first.
* If no conditions at all are met, Base Language text will be used,
* so you should generally always define an "＠else" case.
*
* Example:
* #Message#
* ＠if V[1] = 1
* There is \V[1] item.
* ＠if V[1] >= 100
* There are a lot of items.
* ＠if V[1] >= 200
* There are too many items.
* ＠else
* There are \V[1] items.
* ##
*
* Variable 1 has value 1 -> "There is 1 item."
* Variable 1 has value 2 -> "There are 2 items."
* Variable 1 has value 99 -> "There are 99 items."
* Variable 1 has value from 100 to 199 -> "There are a lot of items."
* Variable 1 has value 200 or greater -> "There are a lot of items."
* ("V[1] >= 100" is reached and met first, so "V[1] >= 200" is never reached.)
*
* Accepted syntax for conditions:
* "S[##]" is converted to the value of Switch ##.
* "V[##]" is converted to the value of Variable ##.
* Numbers and string literals remain the same.
* "true"/"on" and "false"/"off" can be used for checking switches.
* Putting ! at the start of something will negate it if possible.
*
* Valid comparisons:
* Equal (=== or == or =)
* Not equal (!== or !=)
* Greater than or equal (>=)
* Less than or equal (<=)
* Greater than (>)
* Less than (<)
* If no comparison is stated, it checks if the value is true.
* (Example: "＠if S1" -> Switch 1 is on. "＠if !S1" -> Switch 1 is off.)
*
*
* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
*  Language Comparison Table
* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
*
* For the purposes of comparing languages side-by-side,
* you can export a "LanguageTable.csv" file that compiles
* all base data text and corresponding language file text in a table.
* 
* It will be generated on launch in playtest mode
* if you enable Launch Actions > Export Language Table,
* or you can choose to export it from the Export Actions menu
* (hold down the Script Reload key in-game in playtest mode).
*
* If any language files are missing text that exists in the base data,
* they will show as "<<<NOT FOUND>>>" in the CSV table,
* and a translation warning (if enabled) will be printed to the console.
*
* Similarly, if language files have too many commands
* compared to the base data, the base data column will read
* "<<<NOT FOUND IN BASE>>>" and a warning will be given (if enabled).
* This can help locate issues when the base data shifts around.
*
*
* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
*  Logging Identical Strings
* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
*
* The plugin can compare text in each language with its counterparts,
* and check if that text is identical in two or more languages,
* indicating that it may not have been translated.
* If anything is found, it is logged to "IdenticalWarnings.txt."
*
* This check will run on launch in playtest mode
* if you enable Log Identical Strings under Launch Actions,
* or you can choose to run it from the Export Actions menu
* (hold down the Script Reload key in-game in playtest mode).
*
* It can return many false positives in cases where
* there's good reason for text to just be the same,
* but it can help double-check that no text was overlooked.
* (The next section explains how to cut down on false positives.)
*
*
* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
*  Ignoring Text Issues
* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
*
* If you know certain text is unused and need not be translated,
* you can specify areas to be ignored in a language script file.
* Ignored elements will be omitted from identical string logs,
* and show as "IGNORED" instead of "NOT FOUND" in the Language Table.
*
* (Naturally, if you want to be able to use identical string logging
* for its primary purpose of tracking down untranslated text,
* you should make very sure that you only ignore things
* that are definitely unused/unnecessary!)
*
* In most cases, you can simply add the line "%ignore"
* just after the marker for the section you want to ignore.
* The scope will be assumed based on file/event/page markers.
*
* Keep in mind that "ignoring" a section just means
* ignoring *warnings* if anything is identical or missing;
* it does not "invalidate" any text that you do provide in that section.
* Thus, you're free to ignore a wide range and include only what is needed.
*
* Example: If only a handful of Terms are actually used by the game,
* you can add an "%ignore" line after the "=Terms=" header,
* and then include only the fields that need translating.
* You will not be bothered about the absence of other fields.
*
* Note, however, that missing translations encountered in-game
* will always be warned about (if those warnings are enabled).
* This is because the fact they can be encountered in-game
* indicates that they should have an explicit translation given.
*
* The following are some more specific forms of %ignore
* that may be convenient in certain cases.
*
* %ignorefile [file]
* Ignores issues within the given file.
* Valid files: Map##, CommonEvents, Troops, databases (Actors/Skills/etc.)
* Can also specify a range of maps with "MapXX-YY".
* If no file is given, the current file is assumed.
*
* %ignoreevent [event]
* Ignores issues within the given event in the current map.
* Can also specify a range of events with "XX-YY".
* If no event is given, the current event is assumed.
*
* %ignorepage [page]
* Ignores issues within the given page in the current event.
* Can also specify a range of pages with "XX-YY".
* If no page is given, the current page is assumed.
*
* %ignorecommand commandname [scope]
* Ignores issues for any instance of the given command name.
* Valid scopes: File, Event, Page
* If no scope is given, it is assumed based on file/event/page markers.
*
* %ignoreentry [entry]
* Ignores issues within given entry in the current database.
* Can also specify a range of entries with "XX-YY".
* If no entry is given, the current entry is assumed.
*
* %ignorefield fieldname
* Ignores issues for any instance of the given database field.
* This applies to all entries in the current database.
*
* %ignorethis
* Put on same line as a command/field header (i.e. "#Message# %ignorethis")
* to ignore warnings for that command/field only.
*
*
* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
*  Message Debugger Menu
* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
*
* In playtest mode, you can press the Message Debugger Key
* (if defined; default F11) to open a message preview menu.
* This presents a list of all maps, common events, and troops
* which contain Message commands in the current language.
* You can then go in and select a message to preview.
*
* If you press the Message Debugger Key while the menu is open,
* it opens a search box to search the current list for a string.
*
* The language file is reloaded regularly while navigating the menu,
* allowing you to edit and quickly check messages.
*
* Message display settings for this menu can be customized
* by editing functions (see Customizable Handlers).
*
*
* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
*  Message Typer Window
* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
*
* Besides text in the language scripts, this plugin also provides
* a way to preview arbitrary messages in-game.
*
* From the Export Actions menu (hold down the Script Reload key
* in-game in playtest mode), you can open the Message Typer sub-window,
* which has a textbox you can type anything into and then preview
* using an in-game message window.
*
* Press Shift+Enter to enter line breaks.
* By default, text will type instantly instead of typing out,
* and if you edit the textbox while a preview message window is up,
* it will automatically update to show the new text.
* You can change these settings by clicking the radio buttons.
*
*
* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
*  Reformatting Language Files
* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
*
* For cases where many changes have been made to the base data,
* this plugin offers a function to "refresh" language scripts by
* reformatting them to try and line up with the latest base data.
* Alternatively, by way of the Base Text Export settings,
* this can be used to split up all-in-one language files or vice versa.
*
* From the Export Actions menu (hold down the Script Reload key
* in-game in playtest mode), you can re-export the current language's data
* in the same format as an up-to-date base text export,
* but using the latest text data for that language.
* It will be saved using the file/folder name "XX (Reformatted)"
* so as not to accidentally overwrite the original language files.
*
* Similar to the Language Table, non-ignored text that is
* not found in the language data shows as "<<<NOT FOUND>>>".
* Meanwhile, excess commands get a comment of "<<<NOT FOUND IN BASE>>>",
* and their headers are converted from "#Message#" to "_Message_"
* to make it clear that text is not currently getting used in-game.
*
* Any comments not included as part of base text export will be lost,
* and the Variables and Extra sections in particular
* may change in order or otherwise become less readable.
* You may want to manually copy these over to the reformatted version.
*
*
* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
*  Customizable Handlers
* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
*
* The plugin code includes a few empty handler functions,
* intended to be customized to suit the needs of a specific game.
* You can either directly edit the content of the functions,
* or override them in your own plugin (loaded after the CTE plugin).
*
* ***** CTE.commandExportHandlerPrefix(command) *****
* ***** CTE.commandExportHandlerPostfix(command) *****
* To aid in translating, you may want more contextual information in scripts.
* These help you expand the script export function relatively easily.
*
* These functions get called for every command in a page,
* and are passed the command object itself as an argument.
* Based on "command.code" and "command.parameters",
* you can add export text for more commands.
* (Prefix goes before existing command text, Postfix comes after.)
*
* Example:
* Suppose you want to include information on the face graphics
* used in message boxes, to make it clear who's talking.
* This would be part of Command 101 (Show Text),
* which the base plugin already handles the message part of,
* but you can append this additional information as a prefix.
*
* CTE.commandExportHandlerPrefix = function(command) {
*    if (command.code == 101) { // Show Text
*       switch (command.parameters[0]) { // Face graphic filename
*       case "Actor1":
*          switch (command.parameters[1]) { // Face index
*             case 0: return "{Harold}\n\n";
*             case 1: return "{Therese}\n\n";
*             case 2: return "{Marsha}\n\n";
*             case 3: return "{Lucius}\n\n";
*             case 4: return "{...}\n\n;
*             case 5: return "{...}\n\n;
*             case 6: return "{...}\n\n;
*             case 7: return "{...}\n\n;
*          }
*          break;
*       case "Actor2":
*          switch (command.parameters[1]) { // Face index
*             // etcetera
*          }
*          break;
*       }
*    }
*    return ""; // Nothing to write
* };
*
* ***** CTE.languageRefreshHandler() *****
* This handler is called whenever the language changes.
* If something using language-based data does not update automatically,
* you can have this function call whatever necessary to make it refresh.
*
* ***** CTE.messageDebuggerPreviewTextHandler(message) *****
* This handler is called when listing messages in the Message Debugger.
*
* Messages are processed into "preview text" for display in the list,
* which includes removal of linebreaks and command codes like \C[X].
* If you want to remove additional command codes added by plugins,
* you can do so by processing the message text here before returning it.
* (The commented code gives an example for removing "\yourcodehere[___]".)
*
* ***** CTE.messageDebuggerMessageSettingsHandler(message, source) *****
* ***** CTE.messageDebuggerMessageSettingsPostHandler() *****
* The first is called before previewing a message with the Message Debugger,
* and the second is called after closing a previewed message.
*
* The first handler can set up various message settings before display,
* such as window type or position, or show a textbox background picture.
* (The default function shows an example for setting background type.)
* The second handler is generally for post-message cleanup,
* such as erasing pictures shown by the first handler.
*
* The first handler is passed the message content and the source,
* since these may be relevant for determining display settings.
* (Source is given as "map##", "commonevent##", or "troop##",
* where ## is the map number, common event number, or troop number.)
*
* ***** CTE.languageCodeFromExternalAPI() *****
* Handler to integrate external language setting via an API such as Steam.
*
* If this function returns a valid language code, it takes priority
* over Default Language as the language the game first launches in.
* Be sure to edit the language codes being returned
* if they don't match the language codes you're using.
*
* The default function should work for a few Steam API plugins,
* but it is theoretically modifiable for other launchers/APIs
* that have external language settings.
*
